# LargeInts
Project attempting to implement any-size integers in C++

So far the library allows for constructing any integer up to max for 64-bit unsigned, based in units of smaller types. I.e. allows for creating and processing
a 64-bit integer construed by four shorts. 

All bitshifts and comparison operations are implemented.
Addition has been implemented.
